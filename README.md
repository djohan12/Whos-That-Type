# Who's That Type?
Semester Project for CSE-40647

# Dependencies:
All required libraries are included in the requiremnets.txt file. Just run pip install requirements.txt

# Reproducing Results:
The main data file (Pokemon Database.csv) is already included in the repository, so once the libraries in requirements.txt has already been installed, simply run the cells in classifiers.ipynb file to build the models and get the performance metrics. Performance metrics after k-fold cross validation are at the bottom of the output for each cell.
